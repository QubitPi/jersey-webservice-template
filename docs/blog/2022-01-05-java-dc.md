A mutable object is simply an object which can change its state after construction. For example, `StringBuilder` and
`Date` are mutable objects, while `String` and `Integer` are immutable objects.

A class may have a mutable object as a field. There are two possible cases for how the state of a mutable object field
can change:

1. its state can be changed only by the native class - the native class **creates the mutable object field**, and is the
   only class which is directly aware of its existence
2. its state can be changed both by the native class and by its callers - the native class simply **points to a mutable
   object** which was created elsewhere

Both cases are valid design choices, but you must be aware of which one is appropriate for each case.

**If the _mutable_ object field's state should be changed only by the native class, then a defensive copy of the mutable
object must be made any time it's passed into (constructors and set methods) or out of ("get" methods) the class**. If
this is not done, then it's simple for the caller to break encapsulation, by changing the state of an object which is
simultaneously visible to both the class and its caller.

:::info

It is implied that the defensive copying is only required when the state is mutable

:::

For example, `Planet` has a mutable object field `fDateOfDiscovery`, which is defensively copied in all constructors,
and in `getDateOfDiscovery`. `Planet` represents an immutable class, and has no "set" methods for its fields. Note that
if the defensive copy of `DateOfDiscovery` is not made, then `Planet` is no longer immutable!

```java
import java.util.Date;

/**
* Planet is an immutable class, since there is no way to change
* its state after construction.
*/
public final class Planet {

    /**
     * Final primitive data is always immutable.
     */
    private final double mass;

    /**
     * An immutable object field. (String objects never change state.)
     */
    private final String name;

    /**
     * A mutable object field. In this case, the state of this mutable field
     * is to be changed only by this class. (In other cases, it makes perfect
     * sense to allow the state of a field to be changed outside the native
     * class; this is the case when a field acts as a "pointer" to an object
     * created elsewhere.)
     *
     * java.util.Date is used here only because its convenient for illustrating
     * a point about mutable objects. In new code, you should use
     * java.time classes, not java.util.Date.
     */
    private final Date dateOfDiscovery;

    public Planet (double mass, String name, Date dateOfDiscovery) {
        this.mass = mass;
        this.name = name;
        //make a private copy of aDateOfDiscovery
        //this is the only way to keep the fDateOfDiscovery
        //field private, and shields this class from any changes that
        //the caller may make to the original aDateOfDiscovery object
        this.dateOfDiscovery = new Date(dateOfDiscovery.getTime());
    }

    /**
    * Returns a primitive value.
    *
    * The caller can do whatever they want with the return value, without
    * affecting the internals of this class. Why? Because this is a primitive
    * value. The caller sees its "own" double that simply has the
    * same value as fMass.
    */
    public double getMass() {
        return mass;
    }

    /**
    * Returns an immutable object.
    *
    * The caller gets a direct reference to the internal field. But this is not
    * dangerous, since String is immutable and cannot be changed.
    */
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

//  /**
//  * Returns a mutable object - likely bad style.
//  *
//  * The caller gets a direct reference to the internal field. This is usually dangerous,
//  * since the Date object state can be changed both by this class and its caller.
//  * That is, this class is no longer in complete control of dateOfDiscovery.
//  */
//  public Date getDateOfDiscovery() {
//      return dateOfDiscovery;
//  }

    /**
    * Returns a mutable object - good style.
    *
    * Returns a defensive copy of the field.
    * The caller of this method can do anything they want with the
    * returned Date object, without affecting the internals of this
    * class in any way. Why? Because they do not have a reference to
    * fDate. Rather, they are playing with a second Date that initially has the
    * same data as fDate.
    */
    public Date getDateOfDiscovery() {
        return new Date(dateOfDiscovery.getTime());
    }
}
