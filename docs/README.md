### Troubleshooting

#### Docusaurus Blogs Relative Linking is Treated False-Negative by CI Markdown Link check

[CI check for Markdown link](../.github/workflows/ci-cd.yaml) (`markdown-link-check`) is turned on and it's not smart
enough to detect relative linking by Docusaurus. The workaround is to disable the link check at the relevant line. For
example:

```markdown
<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->
known. Additionally, this process makes it easy to implement a [blue-green deployment](continuous-delivery) or
<!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->
```
